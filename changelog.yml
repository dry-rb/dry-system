- version: 0.19.0
  date: 2021-04-20
  summary:
    This release marks a huge step forward for dry-system, bringing support for Zeitwerk and other autoloaders, plus clearer configuration and improved consistency around component resolution for both finalized and lazy loading containers. [Read the announcement post](https://dry-rb.org/news/2021/04/22/dry-system-0-19-released-with-zeitwerk-support-and-more-leading-the-way-for-hanami-2-0/) for a high-level tour of the new features.
  added:
  - |-
    New `component_dirs` setting on `Dry::System::Container`, which must be used for specifying the directories which dry-system will search for component source files.

      Each added component dir is relative to the container's `root`, and can have its own set of settings configured:

      ```ruby
      class MyApp::Container < Dry::System::Container
        configure do |config|
          config.root = __dir__

          # Defaults for all component dirs can be configured separately
          config.component_dirs.auto_register = true # default is already true

          # Component dirs can be added and configured independently
          config.component_dirs.add "lib" do |dir|
            dir.add_to_load_path = true # defaults to true
            dir.default_namespace = "my_app"
          end

          # All component dir settings are optional. Component dirs relying on default
          # settings can be added like so:
          config.component_dirs.add "custom_components"
        end
      end
      ```

      The following settings are available for configuring added `component_dirs`:

      - `auto_register`, a boolean, or a proc accepting a `Dry::System::Component` instance and returning a truthy or falsey value. Providing a proc allows an auto-registration policy to apply on a per-component basis
      - `add_to_load_path`, a boolean
      - `default_namespace`, a string representing the leading namespace segments to be stripped from the component's identifier (given the identifier is derived from the component's fully qualified class name)
      - `loader`, a custom replacement for the default `Dry::System::Loader` to be used for the component dir
      - `memoize`, a boolean, to enable/disable memoizing all components in the directory, or a proc accepting a `Dry::System::Component` instance and returning a truthy or falsey value. Providing a proc allows a memoization policy to apply on a per-component basis

      _All component dir settings are optional._

      (@timriley in #155, #157, and #162)
  - |-
    A new autoloading-friendly `Dry::System::Loader::Autoloading` is available, which is tested to work with [Zeitwerk](https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk) 🎉

      Configure this on the container (via a component dir `loader` setting), and the loader will no longer `require` any components, instead allowing missing constant resolution to trigger the loading of the required file.

      This loader presumes an autoloading system like Zeitwerk has already been enabled and appropriately configured.

      A recommended setup is as follows:

      ```ruby
      require "dry/system/container"
      require "dry/system/loader/autoloading"
      require "zeitwerk"

      class MyApp::Container < Dry::System::Container
        configure do |config|
          config.root = __dir__

          config.component_dirs.loader = Dry::System::Loader::Autoloading
          config.component_dirs.add_to_load_path = false

          config.component_dirs.add "lib" do |dir|
            # ...
          end
        end
      end

      loader = Zeitwerk::Loader.new
      loader.push_dir MyApp::Container.config.root.join("lib").realpath
      loader.setup
      ```

    [BREAKING] `Dry::System::Component` instances (which users of dry-system will interact with via custom loaders, as well as via the `auto_register` and `memoize` component dir settings described above) now return a `Dry::System::Identifier` from their `#identifier` method. The raw identifier string may be accessed via the identifier's own `#key` or `#to_s` methods. `Identifier` also provides a helpful namespace-aware `#start_with?` method for returning whether the identifier begins with the provided namespace(s) (@timriley in #158)
  changed:
  - "Components with `# auto_register: false` magic comments in their source files are now properly ignored when lazy loading (@timriley in #155)"
  - "`# memoize: true` and `# memoize: false` magic comments at top of component files are now respected (@timriley in #155)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Dry::System::Container.load_paths!` has been renamed to `.add_to_load_path!`. This method now exists as a mere convenience only. Calling this method is no longer required for any configured `component_dirs`; these are now added to the load path automatically (@timriley in #153 and #155)"
  - "[BREAKING] `auto_register` container setting has been removed. Configured directories to be auto-registered by adding `component_dirs` instead (@timriley in #155)"
  - "[BREAKING] `default_namespace` container setting has been removed. Set it when adding `component_dirs` instead (@timriley in #155)"
  - "[BREAKING] `loader` container setting has been nested under `component_dirs`, now available as `component_dirs.loader` to configure a default loader for all component dirs, as well as on individual component dirs when being added (@timriley in #162)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Dry::System::ComponentLoadError` is no longer raised when a component could not be lazy loaded; this was only raised in a single specific failure condition. Instead, a `Dry::Container::Error` is raised in all cases of components failing to load (@timriley in #155)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Dry::System::Container.auto_register!` has been removed. Configure `component_dirs` instead. (@timriley in #157)"
  - "[BREAKING] The `Dry::System::Loader` interface has changed. It is now a static interface, no longer initialized with a component. The component is instead passed to each method as an argument: `.require!(component)`, `.call(component, *args)`, `.constant(component)` (@timriley in #157)"
  - "[BREAKING] `Dry::System::Container.require_path` has been removed. Provide custom require behavior by configuring your own `loader` (@timriley in #153)"

    New `bootable_dirs` setting on `Dry::System::Container`, which accepts paths to multiple directories for looking up bootable component files. (@timriley in PR #151)

      For each entry in the `bootable_dirs` array, relative directories will be appended to the container's `root`, and absolute directories will be left unchanged.

      When searching for bootable files, the first match will win, and any subsequent same-named files will not be loaded. In this way, the `bootable_dirs` act similarly to the `$PATH` in a shell environment.

  summary: for multi-container setups. As part of this release `dry-system` has been
    renamed to `dry-system`.
  added:
  - |-
    Boot DSL with:
      - Lifecycle triggers: `init`, `start` and `stop` (solnic)
      - `use` method which auto-boots a dependency and makes it available in the booting context (solnic)
  - When a component relies on a bootable component, and is being loaded in isolation,
    the component will be booted automatically (solnic)
  changed:
  - "[BREAKING] `Dry::Component::Container` is now `Dry::System::Container` (solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] Configurable `loader` is now a class that accepts container's config
    and responds to `#constant` and `#instance` (solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] `core_dir` renameda to `system_dir` and defaults to `system` (solnic)"
  - "[BREAKING] `auto_register!` yields `Component` objects (solnic)"
- version: 0.4.3
  date: '2016-08-01'
  fixed:
  - Return immediately from `Container.load_component` if the requested component
    key already exists in the container. This fixes a crash when requesting to load
    a manually registered component with a name that doesn't map to a filename (timriley
    in [#24](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/24))
- version: 0.4.2
  date: '2016-07-26'
  fixed:
  - Ensure file components can be loaded when they're requested for the first time
    using their shorthand container identifier (i.e. with the container's default
    namespace removed) (timriley)
- version: 0.4.1
  date: '2016-07-26'
  fixed:
  - Require the 0.4.0 release of dry-auto_inject for the features below (in 0.4.0)
    to work properly (timriley)
- version: 0.4.0
  date: '2016-07-26'
  added:
  - |-
    Support for supplying a default namespace to a container, which is passed to the container's injector to allow for convenient shorthand access to registered objects in the same namespace (timriley in [#20](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/20))

      ```ruby
      # Set up container with default namespace
      module Admin
        class Container < Dry::Component::Container
          configure do |config|
            config.root = Pathname.new(__dir__).join("../..")
            config.default_namespace = "admin"
          end
        end

        Import = Container.injector
      end

      module Admin
        class CreateUser
          # "users.repository" will resolve an Admin::Users::Repository instance,
          # where previously you had to identify it as "admin.users.repository"
          include Admin::Import["users.repository"]
        end
      end
      ```
  - Support for supplying to options directly to dry-auto_inject's `Builder` via `Dry::Component::Container#injector(options)`.
    This allows you to provide dry-auto_inject customizations like your own container
    of injection strategies (timriley in [#20](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/20))
  - Support for accessing all available injector strategies, not just the defaults
    (e.g. `MyContainer.injector.some_custom_strategy`) (timriley in [#19](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/19))
  changed:
  - Subclasses of `Dry::Component::Container` no longer have an `Injector` constant
    automatically defined within them. The recommended approach is to save your own
    injector object to a constant, which allows you to pass options to it at the same
    time, e.g. `MyApp::Import = MyApp::Container.injector(my_options)` (timriley in
    [#19](https://github.com/dry-rb/dry-system/pull/19))
- version: 0.3.0
  date: '2016-06-18'
  changed:
  - 'Removed two pieces that are moving to dry-web:'
  - Removed `env` setting from `Container` (timriley)
  - Removed `Dry::Component::Config` and `options` setting from `Container` (timriley)
  - Changed `Component#configure` behavior so it can be run multiple times for configuration
    to be applied in multiple passes (timriley)
  summary: 'Removed two pieces that are moving to dry-web:'
- version: 0.2.0
  date: '2016-06-13'
  changed:
  - Component core directory is now `component/` by default (timriley)
  - Injector default stragegy is now whatever dry-auto_inject's default is (rather
    than hard-coding a particular default strategy for dry-system) (timriley)
  fixed:
  - Fixed bug where specified auto-inject strategies were not respected (timriley)
- version: 0.1.0
  date: '2016-06-07'
  added:
  - Provide a dependency injector as an `Inject` constant inside any subclass of `Dry::Component::Container`.
    This injector supports all of `dry-auto_inject`'s default injection strategies,
    and will lazily load any dependencies as they are injected. It also supports arbitrarily
    switching strategies, so they can be used in different classes as required (e.g.
    `include MyComponent::Inject.args["dep"]`) (timriley)
  - 'Support aliased dependency names when calling the injector object (e.g. `MyComponent::Inject[foo:
    "my_app.foo", bar: "another.thing"]`) (timriley)'
  - |-

  - Container object is passed to `Container.finalize` blocks (solnic)
  - Allow `Pathname` objects passed to `Container.require` (solnic)
  - Support lazily loading missing dependencies from imported containers (solnic)
  - "`Container.import_module` renamed to `.injector` (timriley)"
  - Default injection strategy is now `kwargs`, courtesy of the new dry-auto_inject
    default (timriley)
- version: 0.0.2
  date: '2015-12-24'
  added:
  - Containers have a `name` setting (solnic)
  - Containers can be imported into one another (solnic)
  changed:
  - Container name is used to determine the name of its config file (solnic)
- version: 0.0.1
