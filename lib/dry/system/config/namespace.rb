      # A configured namespace for a component dir
      #
      # Namespaces consist of three elements:
      #
      # - The `path` within the component dir to which its namespace rules should apply.
      # - A `key`, which determines the leading part of the key used to register
      #   each component in the container.
      # - A `const`, which is the Ruby namespace expected to contain the class constants
      #   defined within each component's source file. This value is expected to be an
      #   "underscored" string, intended to be run through the configured inflector to be
      #   converted into a real constant (e.g. `"foo_bar/baz"` will become `FooBar::Baz`)
      #
      # Namespaces are added and configured for a component dir via {Namespaces#add}.
